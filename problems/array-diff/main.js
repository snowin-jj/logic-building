/**
 * Array.diff
 * 
 
Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.
    arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]

If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:
    arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
 */

function arrayDiff(arr1 = [], arr2 = []) {
  if (arr1.length <= 0) return [];
  else if (arr2.length <= 0) return arr1;

  return [...arr1, ...arr2].filter(
    (item) => item !== arr2.find((i) => i === item)
  );
}

console.log(arrayDiff([-17, 0, 14], [-17, 0]));
